# odin-recipes

On this project, I will be showing off the skills that I have learned so far including a bit of html, git, and good git practices.

The task at hand is to build a website that links to different recipes, each recipe will have its own page within the local folder.

I'll use lists, images, tags, and the appropriate attributes.

I will be doing a little self-reflection at the end of the project to review what I have learned and it wil be registered here.
